## Questions

**Question 1a: What type of authentication are we using here (currently)? Does it use any
keys?**

**Question 1b: Both TLS (encryption) and crypto authentication use public-private key pairs.
For TLS encryption what keys are used when the client sends a message to the server?
For crypto authentication, explain how the server can verify a message is from a given
client?**

**Question 2: Here we created a pair of asymmetric keys. What are their names? Which one
is the public key and which one is the private key?**

**Question 3: What is a certificate authority (CA) for public keys? What kind of attack can
a CA prevent?**
